## Credit

Used [MCDAG](https://github.com/robertoxmed/MC-DAG) as a tool to create training sets, necessary `.jar` files included.

## Usage

### Generator

`generator.py` is a script for generating and saving training-sets in `graphs` as `pickle` files (needs to be run with config-flags). \ 
`uav.py` generates the singular real-life application graph.

### Model

`main.py` (needs to be run with config-flags) executes the models training and prediction, aswell as other methods for comparison from `methods.py`.
